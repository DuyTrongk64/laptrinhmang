Most interprocess communication uses the client server model.
These terms refer to the two processes which will be communicating with each other.
One of the two processes, the client, connects to the other process, the server, typically to make a request for information.
A good analogy is a person who makes a phone call to another person.
The system calls for establishing a connection are somewhat different for the client and the server, but both involve the basic construct of a socket.
A socket is one end of an interprocess communication channel.
The two processes each establish their own socket.
